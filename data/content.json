In additional to clearing and grinding the rhizomes of this invasive bamboo, they ground down an additional 11 shrubs and tree stumps for us. They went above and beyond to clean up my yard as if it were their own. What a makeover. Don’t just go with the first results on google when you’re looking for tree care and stump grinding in the Richmond Hill area, Cole Tree Care is the company you want to call."

They were very careful to avoid damaging anything while taking down large trees, and hauled everything away. Will refer all friends to this company. Affordable and quick, thank you so much!", "type": "Commercial Property"

He even cleaned up a few other areas of the property that weren't on his list. He cleaned up everything including debris left by another company months ago. We will most definitely use him for future jobs. Thank you for your professionalism!"
